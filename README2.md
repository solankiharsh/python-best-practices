# Python: Percipio

- What are python conventions?
- Why are they important?

# PEP8 (Python Enhancement Proposals)

- indentation
- blank lines
- string quotes
- naming conventions
- whitespaces in expressions and statements
- function annotations

Naming: CamelCase

# Documentation: 

- small description of what the code actually does. How should be readable from the code itself. 

# Pylint: 

- A source-code, bug, and quality checker (scan your code and grade it)

## Pythonic

- is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python’s minimalist and emphasis on readability

- list comprehensions
- exception handling
- context managers
- decorators
- generators

- Python is dynamically types language. It does not know about the type of the variable until the code is run. 
- This makes writing code very fast but error prone. 

# Static Typing: 

- In static typed languages type checking is done at compile time, whereas in dynamic typed languages type checking is done at run-time. Java, C, C++ are static typed langugages

# Unit testing:

- software testing method by which individual units of source code - sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures - are tested to determine whether they are fit for use

# Test driven development: 

- Software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all the test cases
- First write tests and then write the actual code

# Pytest: 

- makes testing easy

# OOP

- improved productivity (don’t repeat yourself (D.R.Y)
- Faster development
- use proven design patterns
- easier to test and maintain

# Disadvantages:

- little bit difficult
- program typically becomes larger

# Data Classes

- provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special methods such as __init__() and __repr__() to user defined classes

# Why use logging instead of print()?

- clear structure
- monitoring
- debugging
- output destination

# Best practices

- use the “logging” module
- include timestamp and log level
- write short & clear messages
- configure for multiple use cases

# What not to log? 

- sensitive information

# Decorators

# Generators

- reading large files line by line
