"""
Complete the code snippet below. You need to implement a timer decorator
that prints the total run time of a function. The output should resemble
the expected behavior below (with a different value for the seconds of
course, because that is depending on the computer on which you run it).

*Optional extra challenge*: use wraps from the functools module:

do_something()  # prints  "Run time was 0.00030457 seconds."
